# Chip-seq-analysis-on-NRF1

## Background
This project was developed as part of the epigenomics course within the Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics.


## Authors
This project was developed by [Elena Sasso](https://github.com/elenasasso) .


## Project Overview
This project focuses on the ChIP-seq analysis of the transcription factor NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1), a key regulator of metabolic 
and mitochondrial genes. BAM files for NRF1 ChIP-seq experiments were obtained from the ENCODE database, and peak calling was independently 
performed using MACS2.
If you want to see the presentation see the [NRF1_chip.pdf](NRF1_chip.pdf) file.

## How to Use This Repository
If you're interested in running the analysis yourself, please replicate all the command in the [epigenomics_command.sh](epigenomics_command.sh) file.
